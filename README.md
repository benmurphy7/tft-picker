# tft-picker
(Created 07/2019)
Generates team combinations of desired length using the (very outdated) Season 1 roster. Scoring is based on a rough algorithm which uses variables such as champion tier, drop chance, class bonus and cost. A few samples of generated team scores are included.

At the time of creation, there were 50 champions in the pool and a max team size of 8 champions (ignoring items). Assuming only unique champions are used on a full team of 8, this gives 536,878,650 total combinations.
